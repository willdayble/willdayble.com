	<p>Will is an experienced speaker, covering topics from entrepreneurship and education to open innovation and technical trends, in a wide range of formats from high-profile keynotes to intimate masterclasses and executive roundtables.</p>
	<p>Anchored in a decade of gritty entrepreneurial, social impact and digital work, Will delivers refreshingly honest, direct, and thought provoking experiences for small and large audiences alike.</p>
	<p>In 2007 he founded Squareweave, a digital agency that helps social impact organisations do digital better. More recently, he’s a founder at online / offline education platform The Fitzroy Academy of Getting Sh!t Done, and Sotto Electric, an electric car retrofit company.</p>
	<p>In his charitable life, Will helped create and fund The Cowalition of The Willing, a not for profit NGO that levers small-plot farming families in Cambodia out of poverty with debt-free loans, financial literacy, and cows.</p>
	<p>His clients include banking and telco giants, large and small charities, and a slew of startups across the world.</p>
	<p>He sits on the boards of a few Australian social enterprises and mentors numerous young people in local and international startup communities.</p>
	<p>In his spare time, Will doesn’t have any.</p>

	<h2>Speaker rider</h2>
	<p>First off, thanks for having me. It’s always a real honour, and I know we are all excited to create a top-quality, energetic event that people remember fondly for a long time afterwards.</p>
	<p>Here are some simple requirements and suggestions that will help us to create a great atmosphere, and prevent a few common misunderstandings and technical glitches.</p>
	<p>Please read this carefully, and get in touch if I can help out in any way.</p>
	<h3>Audio visual</h3>
	<p>I generally use my own laptop and clicker, and have my own VGA and DVI cable adaptors (I use a recent MacBook Air). If I must use your presentation tech, please ensure we are using an up to date version of Keynote, with a quality clicker ahead of time.</p>
	<p>I do not usually require sound output. I will let you know ahead of time if I do.</p>
	<p>My laptop - or the speaker monitor - should be positioned to the side of the stage, within easy view of the most distant place I will be standing on the stage. I move around a lot.</p>
	<p>For groups of more than about 20 people I prefer a wireless lavalier or head mic. I dance about and wave my arms, which doesn’t work with a handheld mic and is impossible behind a podium. </p>
	<p>Have a clear, open stage area. I don’t hide behind podiums or sit on chairs, so we don’t need any of those things on the stage during my talk.</p>
	<p>Tech glitches are never fun, so I will work with your tech team on an A/V check, preferably 20-30 minutes before I go on stage.</p>
	<h3>Slides and handouts</h3>
	<p>I do not convert my presentations to any standard template. My slides are purposefully crafted for each event, to match the content I deliver on the day.</p>
	<p>I will happily supply you with a copy of my slides in PDF format to distribute to delegates after the event, just ask.</p>
	<p>I retain ownership of all material I produce, and will sometimes make slides or working material available for download online after the event.</p>
	<p>Feel free to take pictures before and during events, but please no flash photography during my talk, I am easily distracted.</p>
	<p>Unless specifically agreed before the talk, you don’t have my permission to record, distribute or resell my talk or any of its material.</p>
	<h3>Speaking topics</h3>
	<p>Every presentation is unique, and requires me to speak at some length to someone at your end about the goals of the event. More than one perspective is most valuable.</p>
	<p>While I have created a list of speaking topics I can touch on, I use up-to-the-day relevant information in each talk and jump between a few topics. This means I can’t give my slides much more than a few days before the talk is scheduled.</p>
	<p>I will not wear a suit and I will probably swear a few times.</p>
	<h3>Logistics</h3>
	<p>To build anticipation and to give time for a thorough audiovisual check, it’s best to schedule a short break before I hit the stage. At the least, ask the event MC to get the audience to stand up and move around.</p>
	<p>Scheduling a break directly after my presentation means people can share “aha” moments and discuss things they just learned. This is where knowledge cements.</p>
	<p>Airlines can be screwy, so when possible I like to arrive the night before the event, and rest well. Please arrange or recommend a non-smoking room close to the venue.</p>
	<p>I like to speak to any executives and stakeholders before the event. Dinner the night before is lovely. This helps me to tune in with the group and their goals.</p>
	<p>If you’d like me to hang around and be sociable afterwards, let me know. Often, the best learning happens in conversations after the main event is all wrapped up.</p>
	<p>Tip: Overbooking a small room is much better than rattling around in a big one, and can have a big impact on how delegates remember the success of the event.</p>
