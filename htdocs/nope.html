	<h2>1) Big bucks.</h2>
	<p></p>
	<p>Will made his first dollar selling stolen lemons at age 6. His father taught him to code a year later. He&rsquo;s failed to get a real job,  instead founding multiple companies across digital, education and social enterprise.</p>
	<p>He consults with big companies and starts small ones.</p>
	<p>In his spare time he doesn't have any.</p>

	<h3>Less brief:</h3>
	<p>Will made his first dollar selling stolen lemons at age 6. The margins were incredible.</p>


	<p>Will's first successful exit was at 19 years old, from a small IT training organisation. The resulting funds were used to start a mental health charity helping young people in the Melbourne punk scene, a web development company and a record label.</p>
	<p>All of these ventures eventually failed.</p>
	<p>Later, Will founded one of Melbourne's <a href="http://squareweave.com.au/" target="_blank">leading digital agencies</a>, a <a href="http://gracefitzroy.com/">cafe</a>, and an online <a href="https://fitzroyacademy.com/" target="_blank">social impact school</a>.</p>
	<p>Unprofessionally speaking, he's crowdfunded an international DJ tour, built a <a href="http://speakerdiversity.com/" target="_blank">speaker diversity initiative</a>, a charity evaluation startup, worked with <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-launches-dedicated-promo-bay-to-help-artists-121129/" target="_blank">internet criminals</a> and filled a warehouse loft with 10,000 balloons.</p>
	<p>Despite a complete lack of qualifications, he's an award winning lecturer, building courses on digital and entrepreneurship at two Australian universities.</p>
	<p>As, investor advisor and occasional chair, Will sits on the board of a <a href="http://willdayble.com/work">handful</a> of Australian businesses.</p>

	<p>Now, Will flies around the world making flappy noises with his lips to motivate large groups of people, which is a very strange thing to do if you think about it.</p>
	<p>He lives in Melbourne, with a neuroscientist and two cats.</p>
	<p>In his spare time, Will doesn't have any.</p>

	<h2>Speaker rider</h2>
	<p>First off, thanks for having me. It’s always a real honour, and I know we are all excited to create a top-quality, energetic event that people remember fondly for a long time afterwards.</p>
	<p>Here are some simple requirements and suggestions that will help us to create a great atmosphere, and prevent a few common misunderstandings and technical glitches.</p>
	<p>Please read this carefully, and get in touch if I can help out in any way.</p>
	<h3>Gender diversity</h3>
	<p>First up: I will not speak at any event with only male speakers, nor will I be part of a panel with only male presenters. This is non-negotiable. </p> 
	<p>If you&rsquo;re putting together an event and want some interesting speakers, hit me up and I can absolutely help you source some great talent!</p>
	<p>See <a href="http://speakerdiversity.com" target="_blank">speakerdiversity.com</a> for more on this.</p>

	<h3>Audio visual</h3>
	<p><strong>It&rsquo;s 2017, people:</strong> Ensure direct HDMI (no RGB) is available.</p>
	<p>I use my own laptop and clicker. If I must use your presentation tech, please ensure we are using an up to date version of Keynote, with a quality clicker ahead of time.</p>
	<p>I do not usually require sound output. I will let you know ahead of time if I do.</p>
	<p>My laptop - or the speaker monitor - should be positioned to the side of the stage, within easy view of the most distant place I will be standing on the stage. I move around a lot.</p>
	<p>For groups of more than about 20 people I prefer a wireless lavalier or head mic. I dance about and wave my arms, which doesn’t work with a handheld mic and is impossible behind a podium. </p>
	<p>Have a clear, open stage area. I don’t hide behind podiums or sit on chairs, so we don’t need any of those things on the stage during my talk.</p>
	<p>Tech glitches are never fun, so I will work with your tech team on an A/V check, preferably 30 minutes before I hit the stage.</p>
	<h3>Slides and handouts</h3>
	<p>I do not convert my presentations to any standard template. My slides are purposefully crafted for each event, to match the content I deliver on the day.</p>
	<p>I will sometimes supply clients with a copy of my slides in PDF format to distribute to delegates after the event, just ask.</p>
	<p>I retain ownership of all material I produce, and will sometimes make slides or working material available for download online after the event.</p>
	<p>Feel free to take pictures before and during events, but please no flash photography during my talk, I am easily distracted.</p>
	<p>Unless specifically agreed before the talk, you don’t have my permission to record, distribute or resell my talk or any of its material.</p>
	<h3>Speaking topics</h3>
	<p>Every presentation is unique, and requires me to speak at some length to someone at your end about the goals of the event. More than one perspective is most valuable.</p>
	<p>While I have created a list of speaking topics I can touch on, I use up-to-the-day relevant information in each talk and jump between a few topics. This means I can’t give my slides much more than a few days before the talk is scheduled.</p>
	<p>I will not wear a suit and I will probably swear a few times.</p>
	<h3>Logistics</h3>
	<p>To build anticipation and to give time for a thorough audiovisual check, it’s best to schedule a short break before I hit the stage. At the least, ask the event MC to get the audience to stand up and move around.</p>
	<p>Scheduling a break directly after my presentation means people can share “aha” moments and discuss the provocation.</p>
	<p>Airlines can be screwy, so when possible I like to arrive the night before the event, and rest well. Please arrange or recommend somewhere walking distance from the venue.</p>
	<p>I like to informally chat to execs and key stakeholders before the event. Dinner the night before is lovely. This helps me to tune in with the group and their goals.</p>
	<p>If you’d like me to hang around and be sociable, just say. As we all know, the real moments happen in conversations after the big event is all wrapped up.</p>
	<p>Tip: Overbooking a small room is much better than rattling around in a big one, and can have a big impact on how delegates remember the success of the event.</p>
